    - merge/refine/refactor/comment
        - giant switch statement?
        - order of functions?
    - the README (including ``sample run")
    - re-run the tests? figure out what the heck is happening with these results
        - evaluations_serial: 1 (the only possible one)
        - evaluations_parallel: 5 (TPB 2^i for i=4...8)
        - evaluations_parallel_optimized: 10 (TPB 2^i for i=4...8, RD 5*j for j=1,10)

- presentation
    - evaluations/figures. presupposes we have figured out what the heck is happening with our test result
    - prepare live simulation?
    - system overview vs. high-level design
    - summary

- report
    - whatever. it's far away. maybe if we approach the due date in serial we'll get there faster since apparently that's how things work now.
