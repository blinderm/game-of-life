- segfault eventually if just click and hold on screen. possibly not freeing memory properly in scheduler? also, why is the coordinate registering as `clicked' so many times? [Anna 04/23]

- have to press `q' to quit (can't use `x' thing on the panel) [Anna 04/23]

- sometimes g->board[loc.y][loc.x] gives values that are neither 1 nor 0 (in toggleCell, ~line 132) [Anna 04/23]

- not sure where to put SDL_Event event polling thing so that is constantly happening. threads?!? ( :(((((( ) [Anna and Zachary (frown only from Anna) 04/23]
